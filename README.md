This is Lanthasoft!

Lanthasoft is (presently) an offline encyclopaedia about the Lanthanides. It was written using Java SE.

In order to run this software, do the following:

a. You need to install recent copies of Java SDK and Netbeans IDE. You can get the former at  (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) and the latter at (https://netbeans.org/downloads/). IF YOU NEED TO, use Google to find more instructions about their installation procedures.

b. Download the source code as a zip package using the button to the lelft or clone the repo to your computer.

c. Run Netbeans IDE.

d. Go to "File >> Open Project...". A dialog box will appear.

e. Navigate to the location where you saved the folder that you downloaded from
GitHub. Netbeans should identify the folder as a Netbeans project. If it doesn't, just continue.

f. Double click the project or click it once and then click the "Open Project" button.

g. When Netbeans has finished opening the project, you'll see it in the 
top-left pane. Click the "+" beside it, and 
then the "+" beside projectpackage.

h. Double click Lanthasoft.java and wait for Netbeans to display its source code in
its central  pane. This is the file that contains the main method.

i. Finally, press F6 to run the software. (Or you can click the green play button
in the top menu.)

Bon apetit!

PS: If you're a Java dev, you can obviously start modifying the software from
here.
PPS: I'm sorry for the long list of instructions. A video should be easier to follow, and I will one day
make one. However, you, my dear user, will have to make with this text-based instruction for now. 

Thank you!!!
