## Welcome to Lanthasoft!

Lanthasoft is an offline encyclopaedia about the Lanthanides. It was written using Java SE.

## Installation

In order to install and run this software, please take the following steps:

1. Make sure you have a strong and steady internet connection.

1. You need to install recent copies of the Java SDK and Netbeans IDE. You can get the former at  (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) and the latter at (https://netbeans.org/downloads/). You may also use Google to find further instructions on how to install those two software.

1. Download the source code as a zip package using [this link](https://github.com/Maviza101/lanthasoft/archive/master.zip) and extract the folder in the zip package to your computer. Alternatively, you can clone the repo to your computer by entering this command in a terminal/command prompt: `git clone https://github.com/Maviza101/lanthasoft.git`.

1. Run Netbeans IDE.

1. Go to "File >> Open Project...". A dialog box will appear.

1. Navigate to the location where you saved the folder that you extracted/cloned above. Netbeans should identify the folder as a Netbeans project. If it doesn't, just continue.

1. Double-click the folder or click it once and then click the "Open Project" button.

1. When Netbeans has finished opening the project, you'll see it in the 
top-left pane. Click the "+" beside it, and 
then the "+" beside projectpackage.

1. Double-click Lanthasoft.java and wait for Netbeans to display its source code in
its central  pane. This is the file that contains the main method.

1. Finally, press F6 to run the software. (Or you can click the green play button
in the top menu.)

Bon apetit!

PS: If you're a Java dev, you can obviously start modifying the software from
here.

PPS: I'm sorry for the long list of instructions. A video should be easier to follow, and I will one day
make one. However, you, my dear user, will have to make with this text-based instruction for now. 

Thank you!
