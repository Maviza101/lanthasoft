This drug is used to help relieve bone pain in some types of cancer that have spread to the bones.

            "	Osteosarcoma is a malignant disease of bone often seen in large and giant breed canines. Unfortunately it has a very poor prognosis because approximately 90% of dogs with osteosarcoma are thought to have micro-metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. Therefore the main goal of treatment is to relieve the pain associated with the tumour and, if possible, slow down the progression of the primary"

The dual radiation characteristic of samarium is important in that the gamma ray activity allows the use of scintigraphy to track uptake of the radioisotope and the beta ray activity gives it the ability to cause localized tissue destruction. When injected in conjunction with a bone-seeking pharmaceutical, it is selectively taken up by rapidly metabolizing bone cells as are found in osteosarcoma. Thus at a cellular level a dose of radiation is given to the tumour itself. There have been several studies done to determine the overall effectiveness of this treatment, but the evidence is mounting that samarium is capable of "
                + "providing good pain relief and slowing the progression of the disease. In patients where the tumour was localized within the skull or mandible, Samarium can actually be curative. In a study that evaluated 15 dogs with osteosarcoma, the median survival time for dogs receiving samarium was 5 months compared to 1-2 months for dogs receiving no therapy. This positive effect on survival was likely due to increased time to metastasis and a slowing of the tumour growth, which was noted radiographically. Importantly, pain relief was evaluated as well. More than half of the dogs experienced some pain relief and five of the dogs were assessed to be pain-free after treatment.\n"
